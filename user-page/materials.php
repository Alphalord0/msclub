        <p><strong>Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC)</strong> <br> <br>
The GRC domain refers to the framework that organizations use to manage and monitor 
their governance, risk management, and compliance activities related to information 
security. The governance component of the GRC domain involves establishing policies and 
procedures for information security management, including defining roles and 
responsibilities for individuals involved in managing cybersecurity risks. The risk 
management component involves identifying and assessing cybersecurity risks, 
implementing appropriate controls to mitigate risks, and monitoring and reporting on the 
effectiveness of risk management activities. The compliance component involves ensuring 
compliance with relevant cybersecurity laws, regulations, and standards. This includes 
identifying and tracking cybersecurity-related regulations, developing and maintaining 
cybersecurity compliance policies and procedures, and implementing mechanisms for 
monitoring and reporting compliance.
