        <strong>What is Social Engineering?</strong>
            Social Engineering is the manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private 
            information, access, or valuable.

            Social Engineering is the term used to describe any cyberattack where a human (rather
            than a computer) is the target; for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as "People 
            Hacking".

            Attacks can occur online, in-person, and via other interactions.

        <strong>The Objective of Social Engineering Attackers</strong>
            <strong>a. Sabotage -</strong> Disrupting or corrupting data to cause harm or inconvenience.
            <strong>b. Theft -</strong> Obtaining valuables like information, access, or money.

        <strong>Traits of Social Engineering Attacks</strong>
            <strong>c. Heightened emotions –</strong> Emotional manipulation gives the attacker the upper hand 
            in any interaction. Victims are more likely to take irrational or risky actions when in an 
            enhanced emotional state. Fear, excitement, curiosity, anger, guilt, and sadness are 
            types of emotions used in equal measure to convince victims.
            <strong>d. Urgency –</strong> Time- sensitive opportunities or requests are another reliable tool used by
            social engineering attackers. Victims may be motivated to compromise themselves 
            under the guise of a serious problem that needs immediate attention.
            <strong>e. Trust –</strong> Confidence used by the attacker to craft a narrative that the victim can 
            easily believe and is unlikely to rouse suspicion. Believability is invaluable and 
            essential to a social engineering attack.

            <td>Phishing</td>
            <td><pre>
                Phishing is a social engineering technique in which an attacker pretends to be a trusted institution 
                or individual in an attempt to persuade the victim to expose personal data or other valuable 
                information.
                Attacks using phishing are targeted in one of two ways:
                1. Spam phishing or mass phishing is a widespread attack aimed at many users. These attacks 
                are non-personalized and try to catch any unsuspecting person.
                2. Spear phishing or whaling is the use of personalized information to target users. Whaling 
                attacks specifically aim at high-profile individuals like celebrities, political leaders, and heads 
                of institutions.
                Types of Phishing
                • Email phishing is the email means of phishing to urge the victim to reply or follow-up on an 
                email request via web links, phone numbers, or malware attachments.
                • Angler Phishing takes place on social media, where an attacker imitates a trusted company 
                customer service team. The attacker intercept communication between a customer and an 
                institution to hijack and divert conservation in private messages to advance attacks.
                • Search engine phishing attempts to place links to fake websites at the top of search results.
                • User Resource Locator (URL) phishing links tempt victims to click on phishing websites. URL 
                links are usually delivered in emails, text messages, social media messages and online 
                advertisements.
                • In-session phishing appears as an interruption to your normal web browsing. ‘
                • Vishing (short for Voice phishing) occurs when a fraudster attempts to trick a victim into 
                discussing sensitive information or giving them access to the victim’s computer over the
                telephone. One popular vishing scheme involves the attacker calling victims and pretending 
                to be from a telecommunication company.
                • Smishing (short for Voice phishing or SMS phishing) occurs when a fraudster attempts to 
                trick a victim into discussing sensitive information or giving them access to the victim’s 
                computer through SMS or text messaging.

            <td>Pretexting</td>
            <td><pre>
                Pretexting is a type of social engineering where the attacker creates a scenario where the victim 
                feels compelled to comply under false pretenses. Typically, the attacker will impersonate someone 
                in a powerful position to persuade the victim to follow their orders.
                Pretexting uses a deceptive identity as the “pretext” for establishing trust, such as directly 
                impersonating a vendor or a facility employee. This approach requires the attacker to interact with 
                you more proactively. The exploit follows once the attacker have convinced the victim that they are 
                legitimate.

            <td><pre>
                Baiting puts something enticing or curious in front of the victim to lure them into the
                social engineering trap.
                Baiting abuses the victim’s natural curiosity to coax them into exposing valuable
                information to the attacker.
                Methods of Baiting can include:
                Use of USB drives left in public spaces like libraries and parking lots.
                Email attachments including details on a free offer or fraudulent free software.

            <td><pre>
                Quid pro quo is a term which means “a favor for a favor”, an exchange of personal information for 
                some reward or other compensation. The exploit comes from getting the victim excited for
                something valuable that comes with a low investment from the victim. However, the attacker simply 
                takes the victim’s data with no reward or compensation for the victim.

                Tailgating is a social engineering attack used to gain physical access to an unauthorized location. 
                Tailgating is achieved by closely following an authorized user into the area without being noticed 
                by the authorized user.

                Shoulder surfing is a social engineering technique used by attackers to obtain sensitive information,
                such as passwords or credit card numbers, by looking over someone’s shoulder as they enter or access 
                the information.
