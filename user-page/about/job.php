reports and other documentation. <br> <br>
<strong>Security Architecture</strong> <br><br>
The security architecture domain of cybersecurity refers to the design and implementation 
of a secure computing environment that ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of an organization's information assets. This domain focuses on developing a 
security infrastructure that incorporates a range of technologies, processes, and policies 
to prevent and mitigate cybersecurity threats.
Security architecture jobs combine hardware and software knowledge with programming,
research, and policy development. Security architects anticipate potential threats and 
design systems to pre-empt them. <br> <br>
<strong>Common Roles</strong><br><br>
• Cloud Security Engineer <br>
• Security Engineer <br>
• Network Security <br>
• Access Control Manager <br>
• Cryptographer <br><br>
<strong>Skills & Attributes</strong><br><br>
• Technical expertise: A strong understanding of cybersecurity principles, 
technologies, and practices is essential for designing and implementing effective 
security architectures. <br>
• Risk management: Security architects must be able to assess and analyse risks to 
an organization's information assets and develop strategies to mitigate those risks. <br>
• Communication skills: Effective communication skills are essential for security 
architects, as they must be able to communicate complex technical information to 
a variety of stakeholders, including business leaders, IT staff, and other security 
professionals. <br>
• Project management: Security architects often work on large-scale projects that 
require coordination with multiple stakeholders, including other security 
professionals, IT staff, and business leaders. Strong project management skills 
are essential to ensure that projects are completed on time, within budget, and 
with the desired outcome. <br>
• Compliance: Security architects must have a strong understanding of regulatory 
requirements and compliance standards related to cybersecurity, such as GDPR, 
HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. They must be able to design security architectures that 
meet these requirements while still providing effective protection against cyber 
threats. <br> <br>
<strong>User Education</strong><br> <br>
User education is a critical aspect of cybersecurity. It refers to the process of educating
users within an organization about safe computing practices and how to protect sensitive 
information from cyber threats. The goal of user education is to reduce the likelihood of 
security incidents caused by human error, such as falling for phishing scams or using weak 
passwords. <br><br>
<strong>Common Roles</strong><br><br>
• Security Awareness Training Specialist <br>
• Technical Trainer <br>
• Learning and Development Manager <br>
• Cybersecurity Education Program Manager <br><br>
<strong>Skills & Attributes</strong><br><br>
• Strong communication skills: The ability to communicate complex cybersecurity 
concepts to non-technical users in a clear and concise manner is essential for 
user education. <br>
• Knowledge of cybersecurity best practices: A deep understanding of 
cybersecurity threats and the best practices for protecting against them is 
crucial for a user education professional. <br>
• Creativity and innovation: User education often involves developing creative and 
innovative strategies for engaging users and making cybersecurity training more 
effective. <br>
• Adaptability: User education professionals must be able to adapt to changing 
technologies and evolving threats to ensure that training remains relevant and 
effective. <br>
• Patience and persistence: Educating users about cybersecurity can be 
challenging and requires patience and persistence to ensure that users are 
properly trained and follow best practices. <br><br>
<strong>Security Operation</strong> <br><br>
The Security Operation (SecOps) is a domain in cybersecurity that focuses on managing 
and responding to security incidents and threats. It involves the implementation and 
management of security technologies, processes, and procedures that are designed to 
prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents. The SecOps team is responsible 
for monitoring the organization's systems, networks, and applications to identify potential 
security threats and incidents. They use a range of security tools, such as firewalls, 
intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and security information and event
management (SIEM) solutions, to monitor and analyse security logs and events. <br><br>
<strong>COMMON ROLES</strong><br><br>
• Security Operations Center (SOC) Manager <br>
• Penetration Tester  <br>
• Security Analyst <br><br>
<strong>Skills & Attributes</strong><br><br>
