        <strong>Terminologies</strong>
            <strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> refers to the development and deployment of computer 
            systems or machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

            <strong>Architecture:</strong> It is a term used for designing houses. In computer/IT terms, it can 
            refer to the overall design and structure of a system or a software application. It 
            encompasses the organization, components, relationships, and principles that define 
            how the system operates, interacts, and fulfils its intended purpose.

            <strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer 
            network known as the blockchain. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or 
            group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. On June 7, 2021, the 
            Department of Justice announced that it had seized approximately $2.3 million worth 
            of cryptocurrency.

            <strong>Botnet:</strong> A botnet is a network of compromised computers or devices that are under 
            the control of a malicious actor or a botmaster. The term "botnet" is a combination of 
            the words "robot" and "network," referring to the automated nature of the 
            compromised devices
            <strong>Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):</strong> Is an industry standard for 
            getting a numerical score to show users how secure (or not) a computer system, 
            application or service is.

            <strong>Distributed (Distributed Denial of service):</strong> It is a type of cyber-attack aimed at 
            overwhelming a target system, network, or website with a flood of malicious traffic 
            from multiple sources. The goal of a DDoS attack is to disrupt the availability of the 
            targeted service by exhausting its resources or causing it to become unresponsive to 
            legitimate users. The first "D" stands for a common cybercrime known as a DDoS 
            attack.

            <strong>Data Loss Prevention:</strong> The name given to technical security controls/mechanism a 
            company can use to protect sensitive or vulnerable data from being leaked (either by 
            accident or on purpose), disclosed or lost by users.

            <strong>Eavesdropping or wiretapping or interception:</strong> Is a term that is used in relation 
            to be listening to something that one should not hear (such as a password). 
            Cybercriminals may be able to do this to users who use unprotected networks to 
            transmit confidential information.
            
            <strong>Kernel:</strong> is term used for the most basic level or core of an operating system, 
            responsible for resource allocation, file management and security. In a different 
            context, this word can also mean the seed and hard husk of a cereal.

            <strong>McAfee:</strong> is a computer security company founded by namesake John in 1987 before 
            being acquired by Intel in 2011, is well known for its anti-virus software that is 
            available to individual consumers.

            <strong>MFA:</strong> is known as Multi-Factor Authentication. This involves using multiple lay of security. 
            An example is the Two step verification used by Whatsapp.

            <strong>OTP:</strong> Is a One-time password. It is a temporary authentication code used for 
            verifying a user's identity during a specific session or transaction. It is a security 
            measure designed to enhance the security of online accounts, systems, or 
            applications by providing an additional layer of authentication beyond traditional 
            username and password combinations. It can only be used once.

            <strong>Plaintext:</strong> refers to the original, unencrypted form of data or information. It is the 
            readable and understandable version of the message before any cryptographic 
            transformations or operations have been applied to it.

            <strong>PIN:</strong> The secret password strictly limited to numeric character is known as Personal 
            Identification Number.

            <strong>Phishing:</strong> The most common cyberattack on the internet that comes in the form of 
            an email pretending to be from your bank or a trusted organisation and asking for 
            your password and other login information.

            <strong>Sandbox:</strong> Is a controlled and isolated environment where software applications or 
            processes can run without affecting the underlying system or other applications. It is 
            often used for testing, development, or running potentially untrusted or risky 
            programs in a secure manner. In a different context, this term refers to safe playing 
            area for children.

            <strong>SIGINT:</strong> Signals intelligence (SIGINT) is the process of intercepting signals during 
            electronic warfare such as radio communications, telecommunications signals and 
            digital communications to determine if they contain any important security 
            information, for intelligence purposes.

            <strong>Social Engineering:</strong> This refers to the manipulation of individuals or groups to gain 
            unauthorized access to sensitive information, systems, or resources. It is known as a 
            malicious actor’s trick used to trick people into revealing sensitive information. An
            example of this is when a scammer poses as tech support to gain access to 
            someone's computer.

            <strong>Sniffing or Traffic monitoring:</strong> This refers to the act of watching or capturing and 
            inspecting network traffic to gather information about the data being transmitted over 
            a network.

            <strong>Data at Rest:</strong> This describes the state of data. It typically refers to stored digital 
            data. It is said to be “at” as opposed to being “in motion” when moving across a 
            network.

            <strong>Kernel:</strong> is term used for the most basic level or core of an operating system, 
            responsible for resource allocation, file management and security. In a different 
            context, this word can also mean the seed and hard husk of a cereal.
            
            <strong>WannaCry:</strong> A global ransomware attack on Windows computers that occurred in 
            May 2017 due to vulnerabilities in a popular Windows service called Service Message 
            Block (SMB).
