        <p><strong>What is Cybersecurity?</strong>
        Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programmes 
        from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or 
        destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal 
        business processes. 

        Cybersecurity comprises people, technologies, and processes working together to protect 
        networks, computers, programmes, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorised 
        access. Cybersecurity is also the protection of internet-connected systems, including 
        hardware, software, and data, from cyberattacks. It is made up of two words: cyber and 
        security.</p>

            Figure 1: Describes what cybersecurity is – securing all devices and systems connected to 
            the internet or networks (Laptops, the cloud, workstations, mobile devices, tablets, 
            servers etc.)

            <strong>Terminology</strong>
            <strong>• Cyber:</strong> Refers to the technology encompassing systems, networks, and programmes or data.
            <strong>• Security:</strong> Pertains to the protection of these systems, networks, and programmes from cyber 
            threats.
            <strong>• Cyberspace:</strong> The environment where communication over computer networks occurs. It 
            includes all online digital spaces where information is stored and exchanged. 

            <strong>Key Components of Cybersecurity</strong>
                Cybersecurity is a complex ecosystem that requires a multi-layered approach to effectively 
                protect information systems, networks, and data. Here's a breakdown of the three 
                essential components and how they work together:
            <strong>. People (The Human Element)</strong>1
                    People play a crucial role in both strengthening and weakening cybersecurity. Here's how 
                    the human factor comes into play:

                    <strong>• User Behaviour:</strong> Individual actions significantly impact cybersecurity. This includes 
                    creating strong passwords, being cautious about email attachments and links, and reporting 
                    suspicious activity. For example, you receive an email claiming you have won a prize from 
                    your favourite online game, but it asks your login details. You avoid clicking the link, shows 
                    the email to your parent, verify if it is a scam, and report the email to online game platform, 
                    this is a user behaviour to protect your account. 

                    <strong>• Cybersecurity Professionals:</strong> These specialists possess the knowledge and skills to 
                    design, implement, and maintain security measures. They include security analysts, ethical 
                    hackers, and incident responders.

                    <strong>• Training and Awareness Programmes:</strong> Educating users about cybersecurity threats and 
                    best practices is essential. Training programmes can help employees recognise phishing 
                    attempts, avoid malware, and understand their role in maintaining a secure environment.
                    
                    • For example, you attend a cybersecurity workshop where you learn about the dangers of 
                    phishing scams and how to recognise suspicious emails. A week later, you receive a message 
                    claiming to be from your favourite restaurant, asking for personal information. You 
                    remember the training, identifies it as a phishing attempt, avoids clicking the link, and 
                    reports it to a teacher. 

            <strong>2. Technologies (The Tools of the Trade)</strong>
                    Technology plays a vital role in protecting your digital assets. Here are some key security 
                    technologies:
            <strong>a. Firewalls:</strong>
                    • Hardware Firewalls: Physical devices that filter traffic to protect networks from 
                    unauthorised access (e.g., Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance)).

            <strong>c. Endpoint Security Solutions:</strong>
                • Software Solutions: Applications protecting end-user devices from malware and 
                unauthorised access (e.g., Symantec Endpoint Protection).
                • Hardware Solutions: Devices like hardware tokens for multi-factor authentication (e.g., 
                RSA SecurID).

            <strong>d. Other Software Solutions</strong>
                • Antivirus Software: Protects against malware by scanning files and systems for malicious 
                activity (e.g., McAfee).
                • Encryption Software: Secures data by converting it into a coded format, ensuring 
                confidentiality and integrity (e.g., VeraCrypt).
                • Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems: Aggregate and 
                analyse security data to provide a comprehensive view of an organisation's security posture 
                and support real-time threat detection (e.g., Splunk).
            <strong>3. Processes: The Roadmap for Security</strong>
                Defined processes ensure consistent application of security practices. Here are some 
                essential cybersecurity processes:
                    <strong>• Risk Management:</strong> Identifying, analysing, and prioritising potential threats to your 
                    systems and data. This allows for the allocation of resources to address the most critical 
                    risks. For instance, to manage the risk of a data breach, the school conducts regular 
                    assessments to identify vulnerabilities in its IT systems and infrastructure. Based on these 
                    assessments, the school implements measures such as software updates, password policies, 
                    and data encryption to mitigate potential risks. Additionally, staff and students receive 
                    training on cybersecurity best practices, and the school develops an incident response plan 
                    to effectively address and contain any security breaches that may occur, ensuring the safety 
                    and integrity of sensitive information.

                    <strong>• Incident Response:</strong> Having a plan to react to a cyberattack is crucial. This includes 
                    procedures for detection, containment, eradication, and recovery. Following the detection 
                    of suspicious network activity indicating a potential cyberattack, the school's IT team swiftly 
                    identifies and contains the threat to prevent further damage. They isolate affected systems 
                    and initiate measures to eradicate the threat, such as running antivirus scans and applying 
                    security patches. Once the threat is neutralised, the team focuses on restoring normal 
                    operations using data backups and conducts a thorough review to identify lessons learned 
                    and improve future incident response protocols.

                    <strong>• Vulnerability Management:</strong> Regularly scanning systems and software for vulnerabilities 
                    and patching them promptly is essential to prevent attackers from exploiting weaknesses. 
                    Vulnerability management involves regularly assessing and addressing weaknesses in 
                    network and systems to prevent potential security breaches. For instance, if a critical 
                    vulnerability is discovered in the student information system (SIS) software, the IT team 
                    swiftly prioritises and applies patches provided by the vendor to mitigate the risk of 
                    unauthorised access to sensitive student data. Continuous monitoring and periodic 
                    vulnerability assessments help ensure the school's information systems remain secure and 
                    resilient against emerging threats.

                    <strong>• Security Policy Development:</strong> Creating and enforcing clear policies that outline 
                    acceptable user behaviour, data handling practices, and access controls are crucial. In 
                    developing security policies for a school, the administration collaborates with IT 
                    professionals and stakeholders to establish guidelines and procedures for protecting 
                    sensitive information and ensuring a secure learning environment. This may include policies 
                    on data protection, acceptable use of technology, password management, and incident 
                    response protocols. Regular review and updating of these policies in accordance with 
                    evolving cybersecurity threats and regulatory requirements are essential to maintaining 
                    effective security measures within the school.

                    <strong>Importance of Cybersecurity</strong>
                        In today’s digital age, cybersecurity is critically important for several reasons:
                        <strong>• Protection of Sensitive Data:</strong> With the increasing amount of data being generated and 
                        stored online, protecting sensitive information such as personal details, financial records, 
                        and intellectual property is crucial. Cybersecurity measures help prevent unauthorised 
                        access, data breaches, and theft, thereby safeguarding individuals’ privacy and 
                        organisations' valuable information.

                        <strong>• Maintaining Business Continuity:</strong> Cyberattacks can disrupt business operations, leading 
                        to significant downtime and financial losses. By implementing robust cybersecurity practices, 
                        organisations can ensure business continuity, minimise disruptions, and maintain customer 
                        trust. Effective cybersecurity also includes disaster recovery and business continuity 
                        planning to quickly restore normal operations after an attack.

                        <strong>• Preventing Financial Loss:</strong> Cyberattacks can result in substantial financial losses due to 
                        ransom payments, theft of financial data, and the costs associated with responding to and 
                        recovering from breaches. Strong cybersecurity measures help protect against these 
                        financial risks by preventing attacks and reducing the impact of any breaches that do occur.

                        <strong>• Protecting National Security:</strong> Critical infrastructure such as power grids, water supply 
                        systems, and transportation networks are increasingly dependent on digital systems. 
                        Cyberattacks on these systems can have severe consequences for national security and 
                        public safety. Governments and organisations must prioritise cybersecurity to protect these 
                        vital services from potential threats.

                        <strong>• Compliance with Regulations:</strong> Many industries are subject to regulations that require 
                        the protection of sensitive data. Compliance with laws such as the General Data Protection 
                        Regulation (GDPR), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the 
                        Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843), the Cybersecurity Act, 2020 (Act 1038) and the 
                        Directive for the Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure are essential to avoid legal 
                        penalties and ensure the protection of data. Implementing robust cybersecurity practices 
                        helps organisations meet these regulatory requirements and avoid costly fines.

                        <strong>• Mitigating Evolving Threats:</strong> Cyber threats are constantly evolving, with cybercriminals 
                        developing more sophisticated methods to exploit vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity helps 
                        organisations stay ahead of these threats by implementing up-to-date security measures, 
                        conducting regular security assessments, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement 
                        in security practices.

                        <strong>• Enhancing Customer Trust:</strong> Consumers are increasingly concerned about the security of 
                        their personal information. Organisations that demonstrate a strong commitment to 
                        cybersecurity can build trust with their customers, enhancing their reputation and 
                        competitive advantage. This trust is crucial for customer retention and the long-term success 
                        of the business.

                        <strong>• Supporting Economic Stability:</strong> Cybersecurity is essential for the stability of the global 
                        economy. Cyberattacks can disrupt financial markets, erode consumer confidence, and 
                        impact the overall economic health. By protecting digital assets and infrastructures, 
                        cybersecurity contributes to the stability and resilience of the economy.
                        Overview of the Cybersecurity Threat Landscape
                        The cybersecurity threat landscape is constantly evolving, posing significant challenges to 
                        individuals, businesses, and governments. It encompasses a wide range of threats, from 
                        malware and phishing attacks to advanced persistent threats and insider risks. 
                        Cybercriminals are employing increasingly sophisticated techniques, exploiting 
                        vulnerabilities in systems, and leveraging social engineering to achieve their malicious 
                        goals.
                        Understanding the diverse nature of these threats is crucial for developing effective 
                        cybersecurity strategies. Each type of threat requires specific defensive measures and 
                        awareness to mitigate risks.
                        Further exploration of these threats, including detailed descriptions and defense 
                        mechanisms, will be provided in subsequent modules.

            <strong>CYBERSECURITY PRINCIPLES</strong>
                <strong>1. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)</strong>
                    The CIA Triad is the foundational model for understanding and implementing 
                    cybersecurity measures. It provides a simple and complete checklist for evaluating an 
                    organisation's security. An effective IT security system consists of three parts: 
                    confidentiality, integrity, and availability, hence the name "CIA triad."
                        <strong>• The CIA triad</strong> provides a high-level framework for cybersecurity professionals to consider 
                        when auditing, implementing, and improving systems, tools, and programmemes for 
                        organisations. It is a powerful way to identify weak points and form solutions to strengthen 
                        policies and programmemes.

        </p>

        <img src="./img/trid.png" alt="">

        <p>
            Figure 7: CIA Triad
                <strong>• Confidentiality:</strong> Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to 
                those authorised to view it. It involves protecting sensitive data, private and safe from 
                unauthorised access. This includes protecting information from bad actors with malicious 
                intent, as well as limiting access to only authorised individuals within an organisation. Think 
                of confidentiality as privacy. Ensuring confidentiality includes implementing data encryption, 
                two-factor authentication, biometric verification, and security tokens. Imagine your diary is 
                like a secret vault where you keep your thoughts, dreams, and feelings safe. Just like you 
                wouldn't want anyone peeking into your diary without permission, confidentiality means 
                keeping certain information private and only sharing it with trusted people. In school, 
                confidentiality might mean keeping your personal details, like your grades or medical 
                information, between you, your teachers, and your parents, ensuring that your privacy is 
                respected, and your secrets are kept safe.

                <strong>• Integrity:</strong> Integrity involves maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data over its 
                lifecycle. It involves ensuring that data is accurate and not altered by unauthorised users. 
                Data accessed internally and externally must maintain integrity so that stakeholders
                (customers, employees, etc.) can trust the organisation. A system with integrity keeps data 
                safe from unnecessary changes, whether malicious or accidental. Cybersecurity 
                professionals implement access levels, enable tracking when making changes, and protect 
                data when transferring or storing it. Ensuring integrity includes implementing cryptographic 
                checksums, file permissions, uninterrupted power supplies, and data backups. For instance, 
                think of your favourite video game where you earn points by completing tasks and 
                challenges. Integrity is like ensuring that those points are earned fairly and are not tampered 
                with by cheats or hacks. In school, cybersecurity integrity means making sure that your 
                online accounts and grades are accurate and secure, so you can trust that your hard work 
                and achievements are protected from unauthorised changes or manipulation.

                <strong>• Availability:</strong> Availability ensures that information and resources are accessible to 
                authorised users when needed. It also refers to the idea that people who need access to 
                data can get it without affecting its confidentiality or integrity. Ensuring availability in data 
                systems can be tricky because it may compete with the other factors in the triad. One of 
                the best ways to protect data is to limit access to it. If you have an information security role, 
                you may experience pushback from customers or coworkers about information availability. 
                Ensuring availability includes implementing data backups, firewalls, backup power supplies, 
                and data redundancy. For instance, imagine you need to access your online homework, but 
                the website is down, and you cannot access it. Availability means making sure that important 
                websites and online resources are always accessible when you need them. In school, this 
                ensures that you and your classmates can reliably access study materials, submit 
                assignments, and participate in online classes without interruptions.

            <strong>2. Authentication, Authorisation, and Accountability (AAA)</strong>
                The AAA framework is critical for managing and securing access to network resources and 
                services:
                    <strong>• Authentication:</strong> Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device. For 
                    example, a company might use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for its employees, requiring them 
                    to provide a password, a fingerprint scan, and a one-time code sent to their mobile phone to 
                    access the company's internal systems.
                    For example, to access your school's online learning portal, students and teachers must 
                    log in using their unique usernames and passwords. To enhance security, the school 
                    implements Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). After entering your password, you receive 
                    a verification code on your mobile phone, which you must enter to complete the login 
                    process. This additional step ensures that only authorised individuals can access the
                    portal, protecting sensitive educational materials and personal information.
                    Imagine entering a secret study group that only you and your friends can access. To get 
                    in, you might need to say a special password that only members know. In the same way, 
                    when you log into your school email or online classes, you use a username and password 
                    to prove you are who you say you are, ensuring that only you can access your personal 
                    information and schoolwork.

                    <strong>• Authorisation:</strong> Authorisation determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. For 
                    instance, in an online banking system, once a customer is authenticated, they may be authorised 
                    to view their account balance but not authorised to access the bank’s administrative functions. 
                    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is commonly used to assign specific permissions to users based 
                    on their roles within the organisation.
                    For example, in your school's online grading system, teachers have different levels of 
                    access based on their roles and responsibilities. Administrators can create and delete 
                    accounts, while teachers can only view and update grades for their assigned classes. 
                    Students, on the other hand, can only view their own grades. This system ensures that 
                    each user is granted appropriate access privileges, preventing unauthorised individuals 
                    from altering sensitive academic data. Imagine your school library has different sections: 
                    one for everyone, one for teachers, and one for librarians. You can only enter the sections 
                    you are allowed to visit. Similarly, authorisation means that once you log into a system, 
                    you can only access the parts you are permitted to see or use. For instance, students can 
                    access their own grades and assignments, while teachers can access the entire class's 
                    information.

                    <strong>• Accountability:</strong> Accountability ensures that actions taken by users can be traced back to them. 
                    For example, an organisation implements logging and monitoring systems that record user 
                    activities on the network, providing an audit trail that can be reviewed in case of a security incident. 
                    This helps in detecting and investigating unauthorised activities and ensuring compliance with 
                    security policies.
                    For example, in a school, each teacher is responsible for maintaining accurate attendance 
                    records for their classes. To ensure accountability, the school implements a system where 
                    teachers electronically record attendance at the beginning of each class. Additionally, the 
                    system logs the timestamp and the teacher's username for each entry. If there are 
                    discrepancies or questions about attendance, administrators can review the electronic 
                    records to identify who took attendance and when, promoting transparency and 
                    accountability in the school's operations. Imagine you borrowed a book from the library, 
                    and your name is recorded so everyone knows who has it. Accountability is similar; it 
                    means that actions taken on a computer or online system are tracked and linked to specific 
                    users. In school, this could mean that if someone changes a grade or deletes a file, the 
                    system keeps a record of who did it, ensuring that everyone is responsible for their actions 
                    and can be held accountable if something goes wrong.

            <strong>3. Least Privilege Principle</strong>
                The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) dictates that users and systems should have the 
                minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions. Here’s how it’s 
                implemented:
                    <strong>• Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> In an organisation, different roles such as ‘employee,’ 
                    ‘manager,’ and ‘administrator’ are created, each with specific access permissions. For example, an 
                    employee might only have access to their own work files, while a manager can access the files of 
                    their team members, and an administrator can manage system-wide settings.
                    For example, the IT administrator holds the highest level of access, with permissions to 
                    manage user accounts and network infrastructure. Teachers are granted access to the 
                    school's learning management system (LMS), enabling them to create course materials
                    and assess student progress, while students have limited access to their own course 
                    materials and grades. Parents or guardians have a separate portal to monitor their child's 
                    academic performance. This way, everyone has just the right amount of access they need 
                    to do their job, keeping everything secure and organised.

                    <strong>• Access Control Lists (ACLs):</strong> ACLs specify which users or systems are granted access to 
                    particular resources. For example, a file server might have an ACL that allows read and write 
                    access to a specific file for the finance team but restricts access to other departments.
                    An example, your school has a list of rules for who can enter different areas: students can 
                    go to the library, but only teachers can enter the staff room. Access Control Lists (ACLs) 
                    work similarly but for computers. For instance, ACLs determine which websites students 
                    can visit on school computers or which files they can access on shared drives. This helps 
                    keep everyone's digital activities safe and organised, just like the rules at school keep 
                    things running smoothly.

                    <strong>• Periodic Access Reviews:</strong> Regularly reviewing and adjusting access rights ensures they remain 
                    appropriate. For instance, an organisation conducts quarterly reviews to ensure that employees 
                    who have changed roles or left the company no longer have access to sensitive data and systems.
                    For instance, your school had a "clean-up day" where everyone checks their lockers and 
                    desks to make sure they only have what they need. Periodic Access Reviews are like those 
                    clean-up days, but for digital accounts and systems. For example, the school's IT team 
                    might regularly review who has access to certain online resources, ensuring that only 
                    current students and staff can use them and that no one has access they shouldn't. This 
                    helps keep everything organised and secure, just like tidying up your physical space.

            <strong>4. Defense in Depth</strong>
                Defense in Depth is a cybersecurity strategy that employs multiple layers of security 
                controls and measures to protect information and systems from a wide range of threats. 
                The core idea is that if one layer of defense is compromised, additional layers will continue 
                to protect the system. This approach mitigates the risk of a single point of failure and 
                enhances the overall security posture of an organisation.

                An example of defense in depth used in securing your school. Defense in Depth is 
                exemplified through a multi-layered approach to security to protect against intruders, a 
                fence, strong locks, steel doors and windows, a safe room, security cameras, and motion 
                sensors. The school’s perimeter fence serves as the first line of defense, deterring 
                potential intruders from accessing the property. A security guard on the school’s 
                compound. A comprehensive security system with motion sensors and cameras adds 
                another layer of protection by detecting and alerting the security guard of any suspicious 
                activity. Strong locks and steel doors and windows further fortify the interior of the school, 
                making it difficult for intruders to gain entry. Finally, a safe room provides a secure retreat 
                in the event of a security breach, ensuring their safety until help arrives.
                For instance, your online accounts might require a password, a security question, and a 
                fingerprint scan, making it much harder for someone to access them without permission. 
                This way, even if one layer of security is breached, there are still others keeping your 
                information safe.

            <strong>Key Components of Defense in Depth</strong>
                <strong>• Physical Security:</strong> Measures to prevent physical access to critical infrastructure, such as security 
                guards, locked doors, biometric access controls, and surveillance cameras.

                <strong>• Network Security:</strong> Controls to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of network 
                data. Examples include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and virtual 
                private networks (VPNs).

                <strong>• Endpoint Security:</strong> Protections for devices that connect to the network, such as computers, 
                smartphones, and IoT devices. This includes antivirus software, endpoint detection and response 
                (EDR) tools, and regular software updates and patches.

                <strong>• Application Security:</strong> Ensuring that applications are secure against attacks. This involves secure 
                coding practices, regular vulnerability assessments, and application firewalls.

                <strong>• Data Security:</strong> Safeguards to protect data at rest and in transit through encryption, access 
                controls, and data masking.

                <strong>• User Education and Awareness:</strong> Training programmes to educate users about security best 
                practices, phishing, social engineering, and other common threats.

                <strong>• Administrative Controls:</strong> Policies and procedures that govern security practices, including 
                incident response plans, access management policies, and compliance with regulations and 
                standards.

            <strong>Examples of Defense in Depth</strong>
                Consider an online retail company implementing defense in depth to secure its ecommerce platform:

                <strong>• Physical Security:</strong> The company secures its data centres with biometric access controls, 
                surveillance cameras, and security personnel. Only authorised personnel can access the server 
                rooms.
                
                <strong>• Network Security:</strong> The company deploys firewalls to filter incoming and outgoing traffic, 
                ensuring only legitimate traffic passes through. Intrusion detection and prevention systems 
                (IDS/IPS) monitor network activities for signs of malicious behaviour.

                <strong>• Endpoint Security:</strong> All employee computers and servers have antivirus software installed and 
                are regularly updated with security patches. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools monitor 
                for suspicious activity and respond to threats in real time.

                <strong>• Application Security:</strong> The company's development team follows secure coding practices to 
                minimise vulnerabilities in their software. Regular code reviews, penetration testing, and the use 
                of web application firewalls (WAFs) help protect against application-level attacks.

                <strong>• Data Security:</strong> Customer data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Access to sensitive data is 
                restricted based on Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring only authorised employees can 
                view or modify the data.

                <strong>• User Education and Awareness:</strong> Employees undergo regular training to recognise phishing 
                attempts and understand the importance of strong passwords and other security practices. 
                Simulated phishing attacks help reinforce this training.

                <strong>• Administrative Controls:</strong> The company has a comprehensive incident response plan in place, 
                detailing the steps to take in the event of a security breach. Regular audits ensure compliance 
                with industry regulations such as the Directive for the Protection of Critical Information 
                Infrastructure, Data Protection Act, 2012, or Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI 
                DSS).
